# Course 2 - Code exercises

This folder contains my own coding solutions to the programming exercises featured during the different weeks of *Course 2 -"R Programming"*.

**NB:** Other files in the different sub-folders (that are not part of the code solutions) have most likely been created as a part of some other practice exercises during that particular week - these files can be ignored. The files that are part of the solution to the actual code exercises will all have the suffix "**\_FINAL.R**".
